            <p>Welcome to my website! Before you start exploring this website, let me first tell you some tidbits about myself. I have a strong passion for art and design. This is probably due to the fact that I was always in "time-out" from being a troublemaker when I was younger. I spent my "time-outs" drawing as I could not play with anything electronic. Whenever I was not in "time-out" I would spend my days playing JRPG games. I was always fascinated with the storytelling and memorable dungeons and characters in the games I played. That was when I developed an interest where I could design characters and maps for games. </p>
            
            <p>I did not start getting into coding until my first year of college at Rochester Institute of Technology. This is when I started to explore coding languages such as C#, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. I, every so often, struggle here and there with coding. I am still getting used to coding concepts and understanding the format for each coding language. There's always something new to learn as I practice and listen to my professors.</p>
            
            <p>I can say that my strength mostly lies within designing. This is due to the fact that I have been practicing since I was four years old. Although coding is not on par with my artistic ability, I still believe that I have the best of both worlds. Not only can I code, but I am always thinking about the end design for my projects; I care a lot about how something looks to the user in the end.</p>

            <p>Enough about me. Time for you to explore this website and allow me to show off some of my projects. You will find several projects I have worked on since I was in high school up till now. These projects range from game design, digital art, traditional art, web design, and 3D modeling. You can find these projects under the "Galleries" menu option.</p>
